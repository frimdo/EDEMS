# EDEMS
Educational DEmonstrative Microprocessor Simulator
## EDEMS  registers
EDEMS has 16 registers, two of those are 16b, others are 8b. User reachable are 8 registers.

| R0  | H1           | R6  | L1           |
| R1  | H2           | R7  | L2           |

Registers 0-7 are user-addressable registers, 8-15 are microcode-only-addressable registers.

Registers H1 and L1 can be used as 16b register HL1,
Registers H2 and L2 can be used as 16b register HL2,
Registers PC and SP are only 16b addressable for user.

All registers, except PC(Program Counter) could theoretically be used as general purpose registers, but some bytes of F(flags) is rewrited after almost every ALU operation. SP is used by stack pointer instructions.

### A, L1, L2 registers
Those registers can be used as one operand of ALU operations.

### OP1, OP2 registers
Are supposed to be used for fetching macroinstruction operands.

### TMP register
Main register of most ALU operations.

### uO
Indexing register for microinstructions. It can be filled with CuO microinstruction or D2O instruction.

### uPCL, uPCH
High and low bits of microprogram counter. Since microprogram addresses are only 11b, 5MSB of uPCH is not used.

Rewriting only one of the registers is not recomanded, since you would jump to another part of microprogram. For jump you should use JMP instruction.

|NA  |NA  |NA  |NA  |NA  | uPC[10]| uPC[9]| uPC[8]| 
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|uPCH[7] |uPCH[6] |uPCH[5] |uPCH[4] |uPCH[3] |uPCH[2] |uPCH[1] |uPCH[0]|

|uPC[7] |uPC[6] |uPC[5] |uPC[4] |uPC[3] |uPC[2] |uPC[1] |uPC[0]|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|uPCL[7] |uPCL[6] |uPCL[5] |uPCL[4] |uPCL[3] |uPCL[2] |uPCL[1] |uPCL[0]|

### F register
F register contains ALU flags. Those are:

|  NA   |  NA   |  NA   |  I   |  V   |  N   |  Z   |  C  |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|F[7]|F[6]|F[5]|F[4]|F[3]|F[2]|F[1]|F[0]|

- C - carry
- Z - zero
- N - Negative
- V - Two's complement overflow
- I - Interrupt?

ALU has 5 inputs and 3 outputs. Most of the operations use data bus as its output, but when the output is 16b, TMP register is used for 4 most significant bits.

## uInstructon set
uInstructions are 2B wide. Opcode usually is 1B with 1 1B operad, but there are some exceptions (JMP is 4b opcode with 11b operand) Every functional block that can have its value (buses, registers) has its own number. They are addressable using that number. u0 register is indexing register. When used in most microinstructions, containing value is used as index instead.

- `CuO + o1` - fill u0 register with corresponding value. u0=IR-o1.
- `ALU + o1` - ALU does operation defined by o1. o1=1=add, o1=2=or, o1=3=not,...
- `2DB + o1` - move value from o1 to DB.
- `2AL + o1` - move value from o1 to AB[0:7].
- `2AH + o1` - move value from o1 to AB[8:15].
- `DB2 + o1` - move value from DB to o1.
- `AB2 + o1` - move value from AB to o1.
- `INC + o1` - increment value in o1.
- `DEC + o1` - decrement value in o1.
- `CP1 + o1` - jump over next microinstruction if value in o1 is 0x00.
- `CF1 + o1` - jump over next microinstruction if value in F(o1) is 0b. uO acts as normal register for this microinstruction.
- `C2D + o1` - move o1 constant to DB.
- `O2D + o1` - move value from uO to DB, o1 is irrelevant.
- `D2O + o1` - move value from DB to uO, o1 is irrelevant.
- `END + o1` - end of microinstruction. Signal for control unit to fetch another instruction.
- `JMP + o1` - write o1 to uPC. 
- `HLT + o1` - stop simulator.

## minimal instruction set

Instructions use two, one ore zero operands. Microcode can operate with "microoperands" that opcodes has coded inside. For example: 
LDa16 loads 8b value from 16b address. Its definition is `|LDa16  (3b) where| + |addrH| + |addrL|`. every `| |` block means 8bit value. This means that this operation has 8b opcode and two 8b operands. The last 3 bits of opcode defines save location of load action (000b - H1, 111b - L2, 101b - A).

### instructions
- `|LD 3b where| + |addrH| + |addrL|` - load from 2B address to 8 bit register.
- `|ST 3b what| + |addrH| + |addrL|` - store from 1B register to 2B address.
- `|ADD 3b where| + |addrH| + |addrL|` - add 1B value from 2B address to 1B register. (result saved in the register)
- `|ADD 2b where| + |addrH| + |addrL|` - add 1B value from 2B address to 2B register. (result saved in the register)
- `|INC2 2b what|` - increment 2B register.
- `|INC 3b what|` - increment 1B register.
- `|DEC2 2b what|` - decrement 2B register.
- `|DEC 3b what|` - decrement 1B register.
- `|TST| + |addrH| + |addrL|` - if value on 2B address is zero, next instruction is skipped.
- `|TSTF 3b which|` - if nth bit of F register is zero, next instruction is skipped.
- `|HLT|` - stop the simulator. Every unknown opcode is HLT.
